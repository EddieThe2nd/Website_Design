    <h1>Boemo-Diale</h1>
    <p class="p1">Boemo Diale (b. 2000 - Johannesburg, RSA) is a multidisciplinary artist ( Currently studying for a Bachelors in Film and Television at The University of The Witwatersrand) who grew up navigating different racial structures in Rustenburg, 
        Mafikeng and the suburbs of Johannesburg. <br><br>
        Her works interrogate the inner workings of her child self that existed in liminal spaces between rural and urban. 
        Her works reflect nuances of gender, race, culture, identity, mental health and spirituality. The works are often playful, 
        a colourful exploration of race, gender, spirituality and identity as a racially ambiguous black woman.</p>
