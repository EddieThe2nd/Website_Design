    <h1>NokuKhanya Charity Vilakazi</h1>
    <p class="p1">Nokukhanya Charity Vilakazi(B. 1992 - Ethekwini, RSA) is a multimedia artist and visual orator. Working primarily with the mediums of photography, painting and video art. <br><br>
        She make works using ibomvu (Red clay) with acrylic paints as a way to show the beauty of her characters as that was and still is a form of beautification practiced by African womxn .
        These works are inspired by African folktales/literature and traditional story telling through a matriarchal gaze. 
        Womxn have controlled societal views of what is expected of them. 
        I had a privilege of being surrounded by grandmothers that believed in enforcing values that we as young girls are worth everything as the boys and they made sure to tell us tales that had a women protagonist they would tell us tales, 
        which were handed down by word of mouth through generations and are an essential part of keeping up tradition. 
        These tales both educated and entertained us. It was or is the backbone of keeping us united and having a sense of belonging within the realms of our ancestors. <br> <br>
        
        Her work is highlighting African women in folktales that illustrate the liberated and disruptive potential of the female power, resilience, wisdom and agency. 
        Authenticate female agency and are restored and empowering to the African womanâ€™s psyche, 
        and it also tells the wisdom of folklore, myth, fantasy, and social history, can instigate social change and egalitarian relations whilst celebrating the women of Africa as key protagonists, 
        profound in their power as in their humanity. A principal theme in my work is Feminism, mythology, spirituality and influences that explores gynocentric norms in an African context.</p>
