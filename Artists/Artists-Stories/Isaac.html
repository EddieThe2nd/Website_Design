        Milenge, Kalashnikovv Gallery, Johannesburg (2020); Alphabet Zoo, Fak'ugesi African Digital Innovation Festival, Johannesburg (2019); and GRAFIKAMA (Service Peinture) Exposi-tion Collective, Nantes, France (2016). His work has also been exhibited extensively at Intenational art fairs and important exhibitions showcasing African art. <br><br>
        
        His family escaped to Johannesburg during the civil war in Mozambique and it is this intial experience of Johannesburg as a young man that has shaped many aspects of Isaacs practice over the years. Focusing on social and political matters in South Africa as seen through the lens of a Mozambican immigrant, Zavale ‘s work navigates the realities faced by an emerging generation of young African artists. <br><br>
        
        His recent body of work mostly consists of inner-city landscapes and portraiture, depicting earnest representations of Johannesburg's vibrant street culture. Placing a spotlight on how people use public spaces in diverse ways, primarily to operate small businesses but also to create spaces for recreation that are not supported by government infrastructure. A collaborative dimension also occupies an important place in the artist’s practice. 
        His work through the artist collective The Alphabet Zoo encourages young talented illustrators, designers, publishers and artists to contribute their work to the South African arts landscape through print making and Zine publishing.</p>
