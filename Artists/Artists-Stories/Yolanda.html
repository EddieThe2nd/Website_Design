    <h1>Yolanda Mazwana</h1>
    <p class="p1">Yolanda Mazwana (b. 1996 - Port Elizabeth, South Africa) is a self-taught artist. Her work addresses themes around mental illness, phobias, popular culture, and relationships. The painter synthesises elements of abstract expressionism, neo-expressionism and symbolism. <br><br>
        Mazwana’s series 'Symptoms of Nothing‘ (2019) uses colour and texture to mimic the ambiguous experiences of a person suffering from hypochondria. 
        This symbolic use of colour and texture speaks to the idea that the hypochondriac is not necessarily aware of what exactly it is they are experiencing or why. 
        The body of work presented in her first solo exhibition 'Secret Homegirls‘ (2019) centres around the observation of the agoraphobic secret homegirls. <br><br>
        
        In 2019, Mazwana received The Bag Factory Young Woman Studio Bursary, Johannesburg, and in 2020, she was awarded the second prize for the Emerging Painting Invitational Prize, Harare, ZW. She has recently participated in the NIROX Foundation Artist Residency as well as THEFOURTH Artist Residency Programme in South Africa. Her work shown at various public as well as private destinations in South Africa and Berlin. </p>
